# nlp_chatbot
This Python code builds a chatbot using NLP. It reads text data, tokenizes it, and responds to user input by finding the most relevant sentences from the data using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. The chatbot also recognizes greetings and allows users to end the conversation with "bye."
